This repository contains two simple Python programs that demonstrate basic operations with dictionaries and list slicing in Python.

## Files

### 1. `dictionary.py`
This script stores a dictionary of student names and their marks.  
It prompts the user to enter a student's name and then displays their marks if found.

**Functionality:**
- Stores student names as keys and their marks as values.
- Takes user input for the student's name.
- Checks if the name exists in the dictionary.
- Displays marks if found, otherwise shows "Student not found."

# List Slicing Example

This script demonstrates how to:
- Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extract the first five elements.
- Reverse the extracted elements.

## Description
- The script prints the original list.
- It then slices the list to get the first five elements.
- Finally, it reverses this slice and prints it.

## How to Run
```bash
python listslice.py
