# Python Scripts Collection

This repository contains two simple Python programs that demonstrate basic operations with dictionaries and list slicing in Python.

## Files

### 1. `dictionary.py`
This script stores a dictionary of student names and their marks.  
It prompts the user to enter a student's name and then displays their marks if found.

**Functionality:**
- Stores student names as keys and their marks as values.
- Takes user input for the student's name.
- Checks if the name exists in the dictionary.
- Displays marks if found, otherwise shows "Student not found."

2. listslice.py
This script demonstrates list slicing and reversing in Python.

Functionality:

Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

Extracts the first five elements using slicing.

Reverses the extracted slice.

Prints the original list, the sliced list, and the reversed slice.
